        Throughout my Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, while leading retail teams at Disney and heading toward my March 2026 graduation, I've grown from cranking out code that barely worked to thinking like a real engineer, with intention, efficiency, security, and communication front and center. Now I break down messy problems into manageable pieces first, thinking through requirements and edge cases before touching the keyboard, thanks to data structures and algorithms courses that forced me to care about time complexity and pick the right tools for the job instead of just brute forcing everything.

I've gotten good at full-stack development, writing modular code that's actually readable, using Git properly, and understanding how frontend and backend talk to each other, which showed me that good architecture matters more than clever hacks for teams and scaling later. Security clicked too, it's not optional anymore, protecting user data and validating inputs is just table stakes for professional work, and my Disney leadership role taught me to explain technical stuff clearly to non-technical people who still need to make decisions.

This program turned me from someone who codes into someone who engineers solutions, confident breaking down problems, designing systems, and communicating why decisions matter. I'm ready for entry-level software engineering roles, prepared to ship solid work while keeping up with new tech and never cutting corners on ethics or quality.
